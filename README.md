SimpleGraph
===========

For Py2, uses Tkinter as graphic framework.
A .app file is included.. it has been created pretty much for fun purpose rather than for actual deployment.
It works fine with Mac OsX Mavericks, I can't say anything about any other version.

I don't actually suggest to download the .app since MacOS comes with "Grapher" built in (which is way better).
